let difference = Math.abs(super.inputNumber - super.actualNumber)

 Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor

viewModel2.data.guesser = new Guesser2();

super.inputNumber() should be super.inputNumber

 this.actualNumber;   return this.actualNumber;

   let coldCounter ,
        coolCounter ,
        warmCounder ,
        hotCounter =0

   let coldCounter = 0,
        coolCounter =0,
        warmCounder = 0,
        hotCounter =0

didn't add setup()
